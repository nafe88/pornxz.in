         <p class="font1">Sex is one of the most common and overrated terms that is used today. To ask 'what is sex' is necessary though as it can mean different things to different people. If we talk of the process of sex, it is simply about people enjoying and indulging in an intimate session with their partner, which can include foreplay, cuddling sessions, kissing, hugging and penetration. For different kinds of sexual orientations, sex is different. Whether you are straight, bisexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual, queer or still questioning will determine what sex means and includes for you.</p>
         <p class="font1">One of the first things you need to learn while embarking on the journey of a better understanding of sex is to let go of all the taboos attached with the notion of having sex and embrace it as an act of love and passion. Different people have sex for different reasons-- for some engaging in sexual activity stems from innate attraction and lust, while for others it is a way of procreating. Similarly, some people may only enjoy physical intimacy with someone they deeply love. Hence, what sex means to you may heavily depend on what arouses you and what you like or dislike while engaging in any sexual activity. Remember the act of sex may be defined as intercourse, but it is not limited to "penetrative sex" or "coitus", rather it entails everything and anything that feels sexual in nature.</p>
         <p class="font1">If we look at the debilitating state of sex education in our country, the mundane and obvious question, what is sex, becomes pertinent and the most essential. Sex is an act of love, it is consensual and if either of the partners is not willing to indulge in it, it is not sex; it is rape. There are many dynamics to understand in sex, what it entails, all the questions that it arouses and about one’s sexual interests.
            Many a times, especially in the amateur years, it can be difficult to understand one’s feelings towards sex. Is it a subject that makes you uncomfortable? You don’t know what you may enjoy in sex? Are you really ready for sex? What is the right age to have sex the first time? Is sex painful? In an attempt to answer questions that pertain to the subject, we look at the subject and attempt answering all these questions.</p>
         <p class="font1">As mentioned above, sex can mean different things to different people. It can be affected by your brought up, your beliefs, your sexuality and even your gender as it is now a matter of study how men and women think of sex differently.
            A sexual act can involve many things besides vaginal sex and may not include vaginal sex at all. It involves everything and anything that feels sexual in nature, such as hugging, kissing, any touch that is sexual in nature, anal intercourse, oral sex, stripping in front of someone, so on and so forth. However, the act of sex by definition refers to the act of penetration, the intercourse. However, many LGBT activists are fighting against this definition as it is heteronormative.</p>
